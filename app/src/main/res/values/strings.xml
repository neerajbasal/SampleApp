    <string name="long_text">The expression language allows you to write expressions that connect variables to the views
        in the layout. The Data Binding Library automatically generates the classes required to bind the views in the
        layout with your data objects. The library provides features such as imports, variables, and includes that you
        can use in your layouts. These features of the library coexist seamlessly with your existing layouts. For
        example, the binding variables that can be used in expressions are defined inside a data element that is a
        sibling of the UI layout\'s root element. Both elements are wrapped in a layout tag, as shown in the following
        example:
    </string>
    <string name="todo">TODO</string>

    <!-- TODO: Remove or change this placeholder text -->
    <string name="hello_blank_fragment">Hello blank fragment</string>
</resources>
